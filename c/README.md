### [C](http://www.cprogramming.com) variant

The wordlist file is expected to be in the current working directory, so the wordlist must be in the same folder from where you start the binary.

Build:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Running tests:
```
./anagrams_kata/anagrams_kata_test
```

Running the main application:
```
./anagrams_kata/anagrams_kata
```

Have a nice day!
